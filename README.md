# better-tudscr
A template for the tudscr (TUD-Script) LaTeX package. Contains an initial template for any thesis and a containerized build environment with Docker, so that you don’t have to fiddle around with the installation of LaTeX. Just build the Docker image _once_ in advance and use it to build your thesis.

## Quickstart

1. Build the Docker image _once_ with `make container`. 
2. Build your thesis with `make thesis`, the *thesis.pdf* is copied to the root of the repository after the build finishes.

Optional steps:

* If your build fails, check *thesis.log* for further information.
* If you want a word count, use `make count`.
* If you want to remove all auxiliary build files, use `make clean`.
* If you want to change the image name of the latex image produced by `make container`, adjust the _DOCKER_IMAGE_ variable inside `Makefile`
* If you want a continuous build, configure the `latex-workshop.latex.autoBuild.run`-setting described below.

All Docker containers are automatically stopped and removed after usage, so you don’t have to do anything in that regard!

## Using the Included Continuous Integration

Every time you commit something to the remote’s `master` or `main` branch, the included GitHub workflow will build the thesis and upload its build artifacts (thesis.pdf and thesis.log) to the *Releases* as a Draft, so you can simply go and download the build artifacts from *Releases* tab.

If you want to skip the CI you can simply put `ci skip` or `skip ci` in your commit message, and it will not build the thesis and won't create a release. For example: `git commit -m "Something I have written [skip ci]"`.

## Visual Studio Code

As Visual Studio Code is the most used Text-Editor, this repository provides some extension recommendations and related workspace settings, which will boost the writing process.

**Extensions**

The following recommended extensions are defined in `.vscode/extensions.json`:

1. [vscode-ltext](https://github.com/valentjn/vscode-ltex): This extension provides spelling correction, but also grammar checks and stylistic errors. All of this is based on  [languagetool](https://languagetool.org/de), which is a very powerful tool, that is able to track high level language concepts, such as cases (e.g., for German) or commas.

2. [latex-workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop): Most widely used LaTex Extension for VSCode. Provides language support and syntax highlighting and is able to build your thesis inside VS Code.

If you open this project in VS Code, it will ask you if you would like to install both extensions.

**Settings**

The following workspace settings are defined in `.vscode/settings.json`:

- `"editor.wordWrap": "on"` - tells VS Code to automatically wrap lines if the text is too wide, which avoids newlines.
- `"ltex.enabled": true` - enables the `vscode-ltext` extension
- `"ltex.language": "en-US"` - defines the language for the spelling and grammar checks. Change this value to `de-DE` if you are writing a German thesis.
- `"ltex.additionalRules.motherTongue": "en-US"` - defines the mother tongue of the writer for the `vscode-ltext` extension. Change this value to `de-DE` if you are writing a German thesis.
- `"ltex.additionalRules.enablePickyRules": true` - enables warnings for picky rules such as passive voice or sentence length.
- `"ltex.checkFrequency": "edit"` - will check spelling and grammar while you are typing. If you want you can set this value to `save`, if you only want to check after you saved the file.
- `"latex-workshop.docker.enabled": true` - enables to docker mode of the `latex-workshop` extension. Thus, no local installation of LaTeX is needed, since it will use docker to build the thesis.
- `"latex-workshop.docker.image.latex": "kaestner/latex"` - defines the docker image, which is used to build the thesis using the `latex-workshop` extension. This will be [kaestner/latex](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kaestner/latex)
- `"latex-workshop.latex.autoBuild.run": "never"` - disables automatic runs of the `latex-workshop` extension. You can manually trigger a build by using the command prompt in VS Code or by clicking on the Play-Button in the top right.

### Explanation

Instead of keeping a local copy of LaTeX, this repository simplifies the process of building the thesis, using a container `FROM scratch` and leveraging the [build output](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#custom-build-outputs) of the docker image. The thesis is build as a step in the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile). Afterwards the generated PDF and log are copied to an empty container image. Using the `--output` command line argument, both of these files will get copied to your local machine. Thus, you can build the thesis, without having a local copy of LaTeX and without the process of manually starting and stopping a container!

In order to avoid user permission problems, you build a custom docker image _once_ in advance, which will create a user which has the same name and user ID as your local user on your machine. As a result there will be no problems, since the files will have the correct permissions set.

This repository uses [kaestner/latex](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kaestner/latex) as the base docker image which is created by [Felix Kästner](https://felix-kaestner.com) over [here](https://github.com/felix-kaestner/latex). This image is only 1.3GB in size, which results in faster build times using the CI.
